## Internship Task-4: Advanced Encryption Tool â€“ Description

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a secure and user-friendly desktop application designed to encrypt and decrypt text and files using password-based symmetric encryption. Built with Python, it provides a simple graphical interface that makes strong encryption accessible to users without deep technical knowledge.

This tool uses the cryptography library, implementing AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, along with PBKDF2 key derivation. Every encryption operation generates a unique salt and initialization vector (IV), ensuring robust protection against common cryptographic attacks. Users only need to remember a password; the tool securely derives the necessary key behind the scenes.

âœ¨ Key Features:
Text Encryption and Decryption: Users can encrypt any message by entering it along with a password. The encrypted output is shown in a secure base64 format.

File Encryption and Decryption: The tool supports encryption of files of any typeâ€”documents, images, or other formatsâ€”producing a .enc file. Decrypted output restores the original content in a .dec file.

Password Protection: The encryption process uses user-provided passwords with a secure key derivation function (PBKDF2 with SHA256), ensuring only the correct password can decrypt the content.

Dark/Light Theme Toggle: The application offers both light and dark themes for better usability and comfort during extended use.

Progress Bar: File operations like encryption or decryption show progress for user feedback.

Output Saving: Encrypted or decrypted text can be saved directly to a file for later use or sharing.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose and Use Case:
The Advanced Encryption Tool is ideal for users who need to securely store or transmit sensitive data, such as passwords, personal notes, confidential documents, or intellectual property. It is especially useful in academic, corporate, or personal contexts where data privacy is essential.

By combining strong encryption practices with an intuitive interface, this tool ensures that even users without a cybersecurity background can protect their information confidently.
